🔥 1) Polymorphism (especially Runtime)

Method Overloading (compile-time)

Method Overriding + dynamic dispatch (run-time)
👉 Make sure you have examples and understand why upcasting works.

🔥 2) Abstraction (Abstract Classes & Methods)

abstract class vs concrete

how/when to use abstract

abstract method must be overridden

🔥 3) Interfaces

Basic interface

Interface vs abstract class differences

Default & static methods (if Java ≥ 8)
👉 Most beginner repos forget deep interface practice.

🔥 4) Object Class Methods

You must experiment overriding:

toString()

equals()

hashCode()
These matter before you use Collections (because collections depend on hashCode/equals).

🔥 5) Exception Handling (OOP + real code safety)

try-catch

throw vs throws

custom exceptions
This isn’t strictly OOPS “pillar”, but most Java OOPS chapters include this before collections.

🔥 6) Inner & Anonymous Classes

Static nested class

Member inner class

Anonymous inner class
✅ Helpful for many real-world patterns
