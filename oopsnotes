by convention use
capital letter for first word for class name,interface
and camel case for method name,variable name
for package use small letter

Method Overloading:
👉 Using the same method name with different parameters in the same class.

Method Overriding:
👉 Redefining a parent class method in a child class with the same signature.


Diff b/w functions and methods :
👉 In Java, there are NO standalone functions.
👉 Everything is a method.
because
A function is A block of code
That exists independently (outside any class)
which is NOT allowed in Java


whereas methods is a block of code that:
Is written inside a class
Is called using an object or class name


WHY USE NEW
new = give memory + create object
It tells Java:
“Hey JVM, make a fresh object of this class.”
👉 The new keyword is used to allocate memory and create an object of a class at runtime.


WHY USE OBJECTS
1️⃣ Access class members (methods & variables)
2️⃣ Store data separately for each object
3️⃣ Represent real-world entities
4️⃣ Reuse the same class to create multiple objects


Why main() is static 🔥 (INTERVIEW FAVORITE)

👉 JVM must call main() without creating an object
👉 So main() must be static

alright

// ❌ You cannot create object of abstract class
// in interface all methods are abstract by default.
// cannot create object for interface

// Abstract Class → YES, constructor is allowed
// ❌ Interface → NO, constructor is NOT allowed
