Revise this once in a while ok and dont worry about forgetting this because these are stuff used for interview and all not for daily implementing i think so cool

string and stringbuilder difference is string creates another string when modified whereas stringbuilder doesnt create one

🔹 Why main is static? 🤯
public static void main(String[] args)


👉 JVM starts program without creating object
👉 So main must be static


by convention use
capital letter for first word for class name,interface
and camel case for method name,variable name
for package use small letter

Method Overloading:
👉 Using the same method name with different parameters in the same class.

Method Overriding:
👉 Redefining a parent class method in a child class with the same signature.


Diff b/w functions and methods :
👉 In Java, there are NO standalone functions.
👉 Everything is a method.
because
A function is A block of code
That exists independently (outside any class)
which is NOT allowed in Java


whereas methods is a block of code that:
Is written inside a class
Is called using an object or class name


WHY USE NEW
new = give memory + create object
It tells Java:
“Hey JVM, make a fresh object of this class.”
👉 The new keyword is used to allocate memory and create an object of a class at runtime.


WHY USE OBJECTS
1️⃣ Access class members (methods & variables)
2️⃣ Store data separately for each object
3️⃣ Represent real-world entities
4️⃣ Reuse the same class to create multiple objects


Why main() is static 🔥 (INTERVIEW FAVORITE)

👉 JVM must call main() without creating an object
👉 So main() must be static

alright

// ❌ You cannot create object of abstract class
// in interface all methods are abstract by default.
// cannot create object for interface

// Abstract Class → YES, constructor is allowed
// ❌ Interface → NO, constructor is NOT allowed


Why .java while running is wrong
| Command                   | Meaning                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `javac Inheritance2.java` | Compile source file ✅                 |
| `java Inheritance2`       | Run compiled class ✅                  |
| `java Inheritance2.java`  | ❌ Wrong (Java tries to guess & fails) |


throw is used to manually create and send an exception at runtime when a problem occurs.

throws is used to tell the compiler that a method may throw an exception, and the caller must handle it.
👉 It does NOT handle the exception
👉 It only passes the responsibility to the caller

in unchecked exception compiler does not force to handle it.
in checked exception compiler forces to handle it.
