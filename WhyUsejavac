1️⃣ Java does NOT run files

👉 Java runs classes.

2️⃣ javac = Compile
javac Abstract3.java


✔ Converts .java → .class
✔ Compiles all classes inside the file

3️⃣ java = Run
java Abstract3


✔ Runs the class that has main()
✔ Execution starts from:

public static void main(String[] args)

4️⃣ Why error happened earlier
can't find main(String[]) method


Because:

Java tried to run a class without main()

Abstract / helper classes cannot be run

5️⃣ Rule to remember forever ⭐

Only the class with main() can be run

6️⃣ Correct order (always)
javac FileName.java
java ClassNameWithMain

7️⃣ Example
abstract class Vehicle { }   // ❌ cannot run
class Car extends Vehicle { } // ❌ cannot run

public class Abstract3 {     // ✅ run this
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }
}

🧠 One-line exam answer

Java execution starts from the main() method of the class given to the java command.
